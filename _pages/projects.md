## Automatic Speech Recognition

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Automatic Speech Recognition For Speech Subtitling](https://github.com)

## Audio Search 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Archival Content Retrieval Through Audio and Text Query](https://github.com)

Improving audio production tools meaningfully enhances the creative output of musicians, podcasters, producers and videographers. We focus on bridging the gap between the intentions of creators and the interfaces of audio recording and manipulation tools they use. Our work in this area has a strong human-centered machine learning component. Representative projects in the area are below. For further publications in this area, see our publications page.

## Acoustic Event Detection
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [AI Based Ambient Acoustic System (AIBASS)](https://github.com)

Improving audio production tools meaningfully enhances the creative output of musicians, podcasters, producers and videographers. We focus on bridging the gap between the intentions of creators and the interfaces of audio recording and manipulation tools they use. Our work in this area has a strong human-centered machine learning component. Representative projects in the area are below. For further publications in this area, see our publications page.

## Music Information Retrieval
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Automatic Music Tutor](https://vipular.github.io/narottam.github.io/)
