### About
Our groupâ€™s research interests lie at the intersection of the theory and application of machine learning - with a focus on applications in Audio and Physics. With a strong interest in the mathematical fundamentals and a passion for real-world application, our group aims on being at the forefront of the field, by carrying out impactful research in the following areas:

  - Machine learning for audio signal processing
      - Music analysis: explainable AI and domain adaptation
      - Audio retrieval: representation learning
      - Speech recognition: confidence estimation
  - Generative Machine learning
      - Normalizing flows, adversarial learning, Monte Carlo, application in Physics (lattice QCD and statistical physics)
  - Time series analysis on sensor data 
      - Sensor calibration: domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning

### Activities

  - Summer Music Course: Swaranjali-2
