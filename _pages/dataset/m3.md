## Description

M3 is a collection of real and synthetically generated audio recordings of periodic tics with the fundamental time period of 1 second. The recordings are done with a number of phones and in a variety of acoustic background conditions. There are 170 real audio recordings and 17000 (100 synthetic recordings per real recording) in this database. For further details on acquisition and synthetic data generation, refer to the accompanying paper below.
