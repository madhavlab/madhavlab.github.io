# **Welcome to the Machine Analysis of Data for Human Audition and Visualization Lab**
Our group’s research interests lie at the intersection of the theory and application 
of machine learning - with a focus on applications in audio and speech processing, and
Physics (generative learning and Monte Carlo). With a strong interest in the mathematical fundamentals and a passion for real-world application, our group aims on being at the forefront of 
the field, by carrying out impactful research in the areas of deep learning, 
machine learning and speech processing, guided by application contexts derived 
from real-world use.
    
## Research interests:

- Machine learning for audio signal processing
    - audio retrieval: representation learning
    - speech recognition: confidence estimation
    - music analysis: explainable AI and domain adaptation
- Machine learning for Physics
    - generative modeling, normalizing flows, adversarial learning, Monte Carlo
- Time series analysis on sensor data
    - domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning
